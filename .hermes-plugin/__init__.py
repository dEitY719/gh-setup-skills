"""Hermes Agent registration for the `gh-setup` skills plugin.

Registers the four one-time repo-initialization skills with Hermes' native
skill loader so `skill_view("gh-setup:<name>")` can load them on demand.

Unlike superpowers, this plugin injects no session bootstrap context: these
skills run once, when a repo is new, and are always explicitly invoked. Paying
for a bootstrap preamble on every first turn would buy nothing, and three of the
four mutate a live GitHub repo, which is not something a preamble should nudge
a model toward.
